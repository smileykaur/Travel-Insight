One day we drove around north, up to a certain point, and we didn't really know if we'd make it all the way around due to condition of road.  We didn't.  The road was fine and we stayed out of trouble but we wound up on a narrow mountainside road with no passing area (2 way traffic) and didn't realize it.  We figured we hit our limit for the day and we turned around at the next pass.  We saw so many amazing things and had come so far, that we figured it was okay to turn back and not push our luck again., crakotta

While it's great you enjoyed yourself, I'm hesitant about your posting of this, the last thing we need is more traffic in this area and the potential for more accidents.  This kind of thing is an issue in Hawaii, and many other places, with social media nowadays people posting things off the beaten path or local spots, drawing more attention to it, leading to potentially negative consequences.  , mxg67

eh8oca8, aujxyb, 2019-02-25 12:39:39,2019, 2, 25,1. Isolation. They're a five or six hour flight to the nearest US city.  
2. Time zone differences that cause isolation. Five hour difference to the east coast of the US and two hours to the West coast.  16 hours to China or 8 depending on how you think of it. 10 hours to London. Hard to really stay in touch with business if you're asleep when a lot of major decisions are being made.  
3. The islands are relatively small. They're each incredibly beautiful, but what the people who grew up there say is that you can only drive the same stretch of road so many times before it wears on you. Certain places will probably never get old though.  , SleepyFarts

Vacationing you there for fun, focusing on enjoyment, splurging on things, ignoring the negative aspects, eating out all the time, etc.  Living there you're dealing with traffic, tourists, crowds, everyday errands, homeless, rundown infrastructure, everyday high costs, long term isolation.  Rarely does any longtime local overhype Hawaii or enamored by "paradise", it just is.  In fact, there has been an overall population decrease in the past few years, domestically even longer than that., mxg67

Some of the places I went like Twin Falls are a bit muddy right now, although they probably started to dry up by now. If you want to escape huge crowds do the drive around the north shore, but beware the road gets narrow and difficult when there is oncoming traffic. You can always just go up to where the road is still two lanes and get awesome views. If you do that drive there are tons of cool places to stop like Julia’s (the best banana bread).

It's on the way to Iao Valley, which you should also check out.  We stayed our last night with a local couple who were AirBnBing out a room in their house and he showed us around.  Ba-Le is great if you want cheap Vietnamese/French food.

If you like nature/history there are petroglyphs in Olowalu and at Nu'u preserve.  Also, Leoda's in Olowalu has amazing pie.

There was really only one time that it got uncomfortably tight and that was because the person coming the other way didn't know common road courtesy., capthazelwoodsflask

Highly recommend going to the Kihei Cafe for breakfast one day, pinapple and coconut french toast was to die for. 
The road to Hana drive was probably my favorite experience of the whole trip. Tons of beautiful stops but do not underestimate the time it takes. I would expect to spend an entire day making the full trip. We left later then we planned and ended up having to drive back early to make our reservations at Spago at the Four Seasons. 
One more great place to eat is Ferrarro's at the Four Seasons. Great food with a spectacular view of the sunset in an open outdoor patio. After dinner you can even walk down to the beach and have a nice walk and just take in the beauty of the place.

Likewise there's always a few out there in any situation who'll overestimate their abilities, ignore warnings, only pay attention to reviews that say "it was easy" or just have no common sense and put themselves or others at risk.

Passing wasn't an issue until we encountered a very large rescue vehicle, now that was stressful, think I got the car up to about a 30 degree angle on the side of the cutout so they could have enough space to pass. We met them in just about the worst spot, they were obviously in a rush to assist somebody and there was nowhere for either of us to safely backup to any usable pulloff. Everyone was very courteous to be fair but I was very relieved that we weren't the vehicle on the drop off side of the road., im_on_the_case

eh8y9pz, aujxyb, 2019-02-25 15:18:10,2019, 2, 25,No, unless you are in a senior position already or have a very specialized role. Pay is usually lower here than the salary for equivalent jobs on the mainland. Jobs are scarce and demand is high, obviously, so more people are willing to accept lower pay for a chance to live in Hawaii. For the locals who already live here, though? This sucks. Many have to work 2-3 jobs just to put food on the table. That is just the tip of the iceberg. We have a huge homelessness problem as well, a big part of it stemming from what I just mentioned above. Not trying to put a damper on things on purpose, but that's our reality, and I don't want anyone moving here with those rose-tinted glasses still on.

tldr: There is not enough room or resources for everyone, so please take a vacation here first and don't just spontaneously move here., SarcasticMethod

Of course people shouldn’t expect to just move over without a plan or job lined up. I’d imagine the best thing to do is get experience on the mainland for a few years while continuously applying for jobs in Hawaii. , KauaiMaui1

I guess I'm more so referring to the challenge level. 

For example, when I was in Russia in 2001, you really felt like you were in a different fucking place and that figuring out how shit worked and where to go and whatnot was half of the fun. I found Russia to be so different that when I left and went to Latvia, Latvia felt like the United States in comparison.

The number one purpose of this trip is to spend quality time with a very old and dear friend - but part of the purpose is to introduce him to the way I like to travel and live...but in a slightly watered down form.

Expensive isn't a big deal as we'll be splitting costs and money won't be an issue for my buddy. I mean, he's not paying my way or anything but this could very well be a once-in-a-lifetime thing that we get to do together so within reason cost isn't a big factor., Oax_Mike

ehaym6b, aun427, 2019-02-26 06:08:17,2019, 2, 26,Depends on where you go inland. Croatia doesn't have a whole lot of inland and what's there is pretty touristy. Greece has more inland options, and I recommend meteora for sure., wanderingdev

[Here's my trip to KL](https://venturecost.com/trip/10103/kuala-lumpur-malaysia), I managed to find a great deal on Airbnb, and decided to live cheaply together with my girlfriend for a month and a half. The food in Malaysia is super good, even on a very small budget!, tomaswoksepp

ehak9mx, austi1, 2019-02-26 02:38:25,2019, 2, 26,Airbus have been toying with the idea - [https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/12/airbus-zodiac-aerospace-bunk-bed-passenger-planes/](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/12/airbus-zodiac-aerospace-bunk-bed-passenger-planes/). Still in concept, but a bare bones one like in trains could work.

Personally I would love one, especially now as flights are mostly going from point-to-point and before long 15+ hours flights would be the norm.

Just to add, I could also imagine that check-in luggage could be eliminated/minimized and have the luggage with you at the side of your bunks like this sleeper train in China ([https://nextshark.com/chinas-new-high-speed-sleeper-train-literally-moving-hotel/](https://nextshark.com/chinas-new-high-speed-sleeper-train-literally-moving-hotel/)).

ehap6sz, auinrr, 2019-02-26 03:39:17,2019, 2, 26,I like and dislike the idea of a bucket list haha. I don't travel to countries just to check them off, but at the same time I do sort of like to be able to say I've been to a lot of countries. 

So my list is pretty vague because there's not a lot of countries in the world that I DON'T want to visit/can't but for me I really want to explore Canada (I'm from Eastern Canada) and the US. I'm hoping next year to do a 6 month roadtrip from New Brunswick>British Columbia>Washington>Michigan I think? 

I want to spend a few months (ideally 3) motorbiking Vietnam from top to bottom. 

I have an insane fascination for MENA countries so I really want to explore Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and all of the gulf countries (except Yemen, because you know..)

I want to do a road trip similar to the Mongol Rally but my own version. In case you don't know what the mongol rally is it's basically when you buy a car somewhere in Europe and then you drive to Mongolia. I want to buy a car anywhere in Europe that's fairly priced and then drive through northern Turkey>Georgia>Armenia (maybe, need to look into how this could effect visas afterwards), Azerbaijan, cross into Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, maybe Turkmenistan if the possibility arises (visas are very difficult here), back into Russia and then into Mongolia. Central asia is such an explored region with so much beautiful scenery and doing it by vehicle just enables you to take in all the scenery even more with the ability to go off the beaten path (though really all of central Asia is off the beaten path rn).

Explore the territories of Canada and some of our beautiful national parks up north. 

Visit Greenland (hopefully Greenland becomes independent someday).

Explore South America in depth. (Lots of beautiful nature again...

Explore every country in Europe, and I don't just mean check them off because I've been there once, but like to actually EXPLORE them fairly in depth.

Some sort of massive Africa trip...

My list is so vague and broad but that's because I just really want to explore every part of the world as in depth as I possibly can. There's very few countries in the world I wouldn't travel to. , SorrowsSkills

Going in August this year :). I leave in 2 weeks for my 5-6 month trip and I'll be finishing it in Egypt hitting up all 3 of those cities. Also look into Alexandria and a town on the red sea I believe it's called for some of the best snorkeling in the world. 

Egypt is relatively safe these days. Of course there was a terrorist attack a month or two ago, which did in fact target tourists but it's not a common. , SorrowsSkills
ehapko0, auinrr, 2019-02-26 03:44:17,2019, 2, 26,I really want to explore Israel as well. I'm really fascinated with all of the MENA countries. I also want to venture into Palestine a bit too. Hope some day they can resolve their issues, though seems unlikely. 

Currently Iceland is the only country I've been to outside of Canada and I went about six months ago for 2 weeks and I hitchhiked around the island. Iceland is one of those countries that no matter how good you are at shoestring travel it will cost quite a bit. I personally wouldn't go back to Iceland without renting a car haha, but most people wouldn't either :P. If you can afford to I'd really suggest spending 2 full weeks in Iceland and renting a car. There's just SO MUCH natural beauty to see. The foods nothing to write home about though. 

I'm Canadian and I'm a bit disappointed at how little I've explored Canada so far :(. We live in such a beautiful country. I'd love to one day get the chance to explore our territories. We really have some great national parks up north, sadly a lot of them are really remote and hence very difficult to get to. Some of them you need to fly to get into the national park lol. , SorrowsSkills

Himalayas is something I forgot to mention in my post! Hoping to travel to Nepal within the next few years to do Everest base camp, perhaps ABC base camp or 1 or 2 smaller treks. I think it'd be an incredible experience and the small bridges over canyons look incredible in all of the pictures for the Everest base camp haha. 

I had to look up what Virunga was but after doing so I'm pleasantly surprised. Based off a quick google search that looks beautiful. Definitely doesn't see a lot of tourism though, especially compared to national parks in neighboring Uganda which seem to have nothing compared to Virunga! Must be because of the instability in Congo. I again had to look up what Serengeti was but again pleasantly surprised :o. 

Again had to look up Omo valley lol, seems like I should educate myself a bit more on African sites. Is Omo valley about the local tribes? I assume so based off of google images and that's pretty intense. That's people look badass. How difficult is it to visit there and how safe? I've seen a couple travel vlogs in Ethiopia and it seems a lot of the country is fairly safe to travel in but I would imagine that the farther you go into remote areas the more dangerous it gets, especially when possibly interacting with local tribes who may not see foreigners (especially white..) very often. 

Antarctica will cost ya quite a bit but that's truly the trip of a lifetime. What do you think about visiting Greenland? 

You're really making me lookup a lot of new places... I'm loving it haha. Kamchatka peninsula looks INCREDIBLE. That's the sort of scenery I absolutely LOVE. Mountains and lakes are just the most beautiful sites to see in my opinion. That peninsula sort of reminds me of northern Canada, particularly northern Nunavut. 

I would definitely loved to visit the salt flats in Bolivia as well, though to be quite honest I'd like to visit everywhere in South America haha.

For northern lights you should look into northern Canada as we recently finished a road that leads you all the way up to the Arctic ocean which I imagine would be a great spot for finding the northern lights. Greenland and Iceland would also be ideal but more expensive than Canada for sure. I'd highly recommend a two week trip to Iceland if you get the chance :P, it has some incredible scenery and a lot of it is actually fairly easy to reach, though that leads way to a boatload of tourists as well sadly. 

I definitely want to see a ton of US National parks as well. I'm hoping next year to go on a 6 month road trip from eastern Canada to west down into the US and back. Washington, Oregon, northern Montana, Utah and Colorado seem to have a ton of the best national parks in the US, also California too but I won't be able to make it that far south on my trip :P. 

> Countries: Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Colombia, Spain, Portugal, Ghana, Senegal, Iran, Uzbekistan, Australia, Greece, Turkey, Bosnia, Ukraine 

In two weeks I'm off to Portugal, then to Spain and two months later to Turkey haha. Really excited for Spain and Turkey personally. Incredible cities like Segovia, Toledo, Seville, Malaga, Granada, Seville, Alanya, Anatalya, Side and so many more incredible cities! If you ever get the chance make sure to explore northern Spain and especially northern Turkey on the black sea. I hear it's incredible!

I'm also very surprised to see Uzbekistan on your life! It's such an unknown country. I really want to do a road trip similar to the mongol rally so I can really explore central Asia in depth. My ideal road trip would be something like this: buy a car somewhere in Europe then drive to northern Turkey>Georgia>Armenia (depending how this effects future visas), Azerbaijan, cross into Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan (if the visa situation eases up), cross back into Russia and finally into Mongolia. Spending 6-8 months on this trip would be ideal for me lol. It'd be a longggg trip but probably rather inexpensive still given how cheap all of those countries are.

I'm lucky and I speak... some French so visiting francophone Africa would be significantly easier for me than most, though I'm sure even English would suffice, as it does everywhere. 

I'm finishing my 6 month trip (that I leave for in 2 weeks :D) in Egypt. I've heard mixed opinions from people but I think it'll be great. The safety situation is pretty stable these days, though unfortunately there was a terrorist attack specifically targeting tourists on the way to the pyramids (bus drove over a landmine or something) but that's not common so I won't let one negative thing stop me from visiting a country. Egypt is basically as cheap as it's ever been too so I'd suggest visiting soon if you get the chance!

If you're looking to see the northern lights try Iceland if you can afford it. Two weeks in Iceland with a rental vehicle and you won't regret it, that is if you can afford it :P. Otherwise perhaps consider northern Canada for the northern lights. We have a road that goes all the way up to the Arctic ocean now and I imagine that'd be a great place for seeing the northern lights.

I'd also love to visit Iran and Tibet. I've heard the hospitality in Iran is insane. So much history as well and it's actually not as strict of a country as people think. The government may have strict laws but the younger citizens (which is the majority of the population) follow those laws very loosely lol. Also Iran is still to date one of the safer countries to visit which is a surprise to anyone who's ever looked at western media lol. , SorrowsSkills

Haha growing up and living in eastern Canada I'm the exact opposite. I want to visit western Canada and northwest USA lol. I just absolutely love mountains and lakes, and when you put them together....... oh man...

I'm hoping next year to do a road trip from eastern Canada to west and then down into the US from Washington to probably Michigan? Hitting up Oregon, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado etc. So much natural beauty around us here in Canada and the US.

 

>Visit Dubai or Qatar

My friends dad actually works and lives in Doha, Qatar. I hear it's a great city! Perhaps look into Oman as well if you're ever in the region. Oman is a bit more 'authentic' compared to Doha, Kuwait City, Dubai, etc. Still fun cities to visit nonetheless.

eh8icdb, aujgei, 2019-02-25 10:01:42,2019, 2, 25,> Are there any cool mountain roads like the ones in US?  
  
Dude! This is Germany! Best public roads in the world! ;)  
  
If you really want to go to the Alps, then the [German Alpine Road](https://www.deutsche-alpenstrasse.de/en/home) will basically end the thread. It crosses all of the German Alps from Lake Constance to Königssee, on a really fun driver's road.  
  
Personally, I'd add one loop through Tirol:  
From Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Mittenwald, passing through Seefeld, Innsbruck, Alpbach (voted Austria's most beautiful village), Achensee, Tegernsee where you reconnect to the German Alpine Road.  
  
If you have the time, take the B roads down as much as possible. B45 through Odenwald from Frankfurt (Michelstadt, Erbach, Eberbach). Lunch break in Esslingen am Neckar. Pass Blautopf (Blaubeuren) and Ulm, on the way to Lindau where you start on the German Alpine Road.
  
  
Hiking is obviously fundamentally dependent on the weather during the transitional period that is March. It is really warm now already. for example, Mittenwald is at 8-9C today at 900m elevation. But there's still snow. So, at best you will have rather muddy conditions. So, if you have no experience in the mountains, best to stick to paved walks.  
  
There are a bunch around Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Mittenwald, and Berchtesgaden. The big name places like Partnachklamm, Kuhfluchtwasserfälle, Leutscher Geisterklamm, Königssee, and Adlersnest (Eagle's Nest). And tons more that you will automatically run across when actually on site by either keeping your eyes open, or talking to your hotel.

eha6gjb, aural1, 2019-02-25 23:41:01,2019, 2, 25,Honestly, the rules of TSA change so often that everyone is fumbling a bit! like one of the other posters said, have your ticket and ID with you, keep your liquids in a little baggie that you can easily take in and out, and just follow what the signs and the people in front of you do :) you can also go on to the TSA website ahead of time and see what they suggest, especially in terms of what you are and are not allowed to bring in your carry-on. That will help you feel more prepared :-), Captain-Fuzzy-Socks
eha6lz2, aural1, 2019-02-25 23:42:59,2019, 2, 25,1) Leave plenty of time. Your colleagues may not want to get to the airport very early. Unless you are riding with them (and have no choice), plan to get there at least two hours before your flight leaves. Thus will give you some extra time to figure out your bearings.

1a) If you are going with them, they may have a shorter line through TSA if they have TSA Pre or elite status with the airline, so remind them you will take longer and figure out a place to meet. (They probably know where the good bars are at the airport)

2) Don't over pack. You probably don't need all that stuff.

3) Is your flight delayed? Don't freak out. It happens all the time. If your colleagues are on the plane with you and they have good frequent flier status on that airline, see if they can help you get rerouted. They have special call-in numbers with a shorter wait than the plebes have.

4) You can find maps of all the major airports online, as well as in the in-flight magazines once you board. If you are going to or connecting through a large airport, take a few minutes in advance to figure out where things are., dhork

ehacw7m, aural1, 2019-02-26 01:06:18,2019, 2, 26,OP can put it back wherever he/she usually keeps ID.  The point is that you do not need to keep it "easily accessible" after it's been checked.  This is wrong.  And walking around holding it or in your pocket will actually cause problems and delay your security screening.

Since OP doesn't know this, I'm just clarifying for OP.  I see people holding their ID and tickets getting yelled at all the time.  Since OP's goal is looking like they know what they are doing and not getting yelled at, I recommend the opposite: putting away your ID and boarding pass., inverse_squared

Easily accessible and where it is normally kept are not mutually exclusive. :)

I didn't say they were.  But you're back-tracking.  The bottom line is that you don't have to put it anywhere in particular EXCEPT actually put it away, which you 1) failed to say, and 2) actually implied the opposite of.  

But the point for OP is to actually put the ID and boarding pass away after being checked.  At the very least, you are missing this required step, so I'm just recommending it for OP., inverse_squared
eh9jski, auoszo, 2019-02-25 19:26:22,2019, 2, 25,I have worked at a summer camp the past two years (although as a counsellor), the kitchen staff who I knew really enjoyed the job and many returned. They usually get paid more and less hours so if you don’t mind the repetitive work its a good option. I recommend Interexchange for a visa sponsor 100%. They only charge the minimal amount as it is a purely cultural exchange program for non profit unlike other companies. I was making over 3 times what others were making in my first year. Its because people don’t know about Interexchange as they don’t spend all their money on advertising like other camp companies. , Mustikka3

They work in places such as Whistler, Banff and Jasper. Google for employment opportunities in those places.

There is plenty of seasonal work up and down the country and plenty if bar and restaurant work too if you prefer that. You really dont need to go through any third party.

For a long time I thought of using a site like [bunac.org](https://bunac.org) but honestly you don't need it. It will probably be cheaper without it too. I don't know if it's been mentioned but there are backpacker groups on facebook that you can join that'll help with jobs and places to live. People will also look for travel buddies to join them on road trips on those pages so it would be a helpful tool for you to network on. Good luck deciding on where to go next!

eh9zrpa, auo9kg, 2019-02-25 22:18:21,2019, 2, 25,The visa is valid for a year and there is some sort of seasonal work going on all year round somewhere. Im in the bay of plenty and they are hiring now for the kiwifruit season and it will be the same down south by Nelson with the apple picking season coming up. That then transitions in to grape vine pruning or stonefruits further south. There is also the woofing option to fill in any gaps. You're not paid but you do get foid and board for a few hours work usually. At the end of fall the ski resorts gear up and there is always work there.

eh8p33g, aukpi4, 2019-02-25 12:54:27,2019, 2, 25,Serious boring answer: stick to simple strolls around the neighborhood. For ex   
  
-  Lumphini Park and Stadium (I assume you are planning to go to latter already), and Silom (Patpong if you are interested in the Red Light District). There is some good street food around the boxing stadium (I used to live across the street, about 500m from the Banyan Tree myself)   
  
But if you do want to walk around on the first even, pick one of these:   
  
- The Riverfront/Asiatique and if you are there anyway, take the boat up to the Royal Palace/Wat  Pho or Wat Arun (you would take the Skytrain to Saphan Taksin from Sala Daeng/Silom). If you want a nice dinner in a restaurant, go to [The Deck](http://www.arunresidence.com/dinning-experience/). Or grab some pseudo-street-food at The Riverfront.   
- if you prefer modern, fancy places, go to [The Club at  Koi](https://theclubatkoi.com/), or the rooftop bar on the [Cube Building](https://kingpowermahanakhon.co.th).  
- The night Market Ratchada Rot Fai at metro station Thailand Cultural Center, on Ratchadaphisek Rd.
  
Mostly though, I'd focus on rest. Jetlag hits most people on the second night. And if you are there for work, you want to be fit. Even if you fly in on Business where you can rest well. Maybe even treat yourself at [Yunomori](http://www.yunomorionsen.com/bangkok/), alternatively at [Healthland Asoke](https://www.healthlandspa.com/en).

I think I'm going to head to National Stadium on the Wednesday night, hopefully there are some Muay Thai fights on and I can pick up some decent gloves (although I have heard 16oz gloves are a bit of a pain to get).

&#x200B;

Funnily enough I'm a massive Pokemon Go so I think an early morning stroll round Lumphini Park is on the cards.

What's your opinion on getting around should I use Grabtaxi or the MRT? I have been ripped off loads by Grab in Indonesia so I'm a bit weary.

eh8g32w, auizqx, 2019-02-25 08:52:59,2019, 2, 25,Assuming you have 20 days between leaving Madrid and leaving Europe, you are trying to do waaaaaaaay too much.  You’ll spend the whole time in transit, checking in or checking out of accommodation.  Pick five places, six at the most.  I’d do Spain and Italy myself - go from Madrid to Barcelona, fly to Rome, go to Florence, Milan and Venice by train.  Fly out of Venice., Kiwitechgirl
eh8hcip, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:31:04,2019, 2, 25,You can easy do Holland, Belgium, Germany and Paris from central location example Brussels/Antwerp. 2hour train to Amsterdam, Paris about the same...don't know the transfer costs are against the hotel costs and if they are reconsider bar., FlemishLegion
eh8p2ci, auizqx, 2019-02-25 12:54:02,2019, 2, 25,I concur, you are doing wry too much.  What you are trying to do is the equivalent of the entire Smithsonian in 2 hours.

My best advice, and suggest, especially for a 1st time.  do a western Europe capital tour.  Fly into London, take 2 nights.  There isn’t a bunch to see here anyway.  See the change of the guard.  If you can add a day trip or excursion tour to Stonehenge.  It’s about 3 hours out of the city.  The city nearby is a great stop too for a night if you would rather.  Either jump on the EuroStar or a cheap flight to Paris, Spend 2 weeks.  There is so much to do.  The Louvre can take 2 days by itself.  Paris has a lot going on and so much to do.  You will find the weather warm and people friendly.  You could pull off a day excursion to Normandy as well.

Rome is the same.  So much going on.  Take an excursion to Pompeii.  Spend a day or two at a private day beach resort at the end of your trip so you can return to the USA relaxed.

Have fun!!!, atwegotsidetrekked
ehaxrbe, auizqx, 2019-02-26 05:51:15,2019, 2, 26,The strength of the train & bus is that you'll have more day-to-day flexibility. Air flight bookings, as cheap as they are within Europe, require more pre-planning. But they do give you ability to hop greater distances in fast spurts across the continent.

So if I were you, I'd pull up a map and try to pin down the major highlights that you for sure don't want to miss. 25 days you say? Each to their own, but for a frame of reference, I found Prague-Vienna-Budapest enjoyable for a 2 week time span. So if you're going to Europe for about a month, I'd shoot for 6-7 major cities - if those cities are all big, big cities and not small towns.

Then figure out if train/bus or plane would be best for linking up your A -> B -> C etc.

The nice thing about Europe is that everything's very well connected. 

And have fun!, Takiatlarge
eh8go91, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:10:32,2019, 2, 25,Flights are often faster and cheaper than trains.  If you love trains and like to relax on them and spend time staring at fast moving country side and a lot of random tunnels....  Then by all means take trains but I, personally, would investigate flight options first.   Trains can take forever to get from point A-B depending on how far you're going.

If the choice is between Rome and Milan... Rome absolutely.  I would also recommend a day trip to Naples (have pizza where it was born ... Naples and their espresso is the best).  From there a day trip to Pompeii is HIGHLY recommended.  Nothing like standing at the foot of Vesuvius in those ruins.   

I can tell you that 2 days in most cities won't be enough but it really depends on what you like to do when visiting new cities.  In Rome the Vatican alone can take up most of a single day...  (If that's something you care to see).  

All of that said - Italy alone could take up your entire trip and you wouldn't be bored for a moment.

I love Vienna, Budapest and Prague options.   Great cities.  Varying cuisine and architecture.   Beer in Prague is amazing - Ufleku is a restaurant / brewery you have to go to!


Amsterdam is cool! Just spent a couple of months there.  Germany has a lot to see as well (I live in Berlin) I mean honestly it seems like your list is huge.  I keep having to go back and look to remember what's on the list.

My recommendation is to spend at minimum 3 days (as in arrive in the morning on day 1 and leave early morning day 4 via flight) in any major city especially if you like to do the touristy stuff.  It all tends to take a while with lines and crowds etc. This will give you time to pick a handful of must see / do things in each city and still actually have time to stop and sit outside at a cafe like the locals and have an espresso and just breathe.

Check flight costs with EasyJet (my preferred airline no carry on weight limit! Many euro airlines have weight limits of 8-10kg for carry on bags).

eh8gzq0, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:20:16,2019, 2, 25,This answer is much better than mine.   Lol Spain and Italy ftw.

I would, however, make time for a pizza and coffee in Naples and a hop on hop off bus because the views of the coast there are stunning and a day trip to Pompeii.

Otherwise Kiwitechgirl nailed it., barbster123
eh8h4xk, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:24:41,2019, 2, 25,100% this, but skip Milan. Instead I'd go for either 2 day Garda lake or San Marino & Pisa, depending on whether you're more of a nature or culture type :), OverAnalyzes
eh8guiw, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:15:54,2019, 2, 25,Thanks for the quick response. Im going to be in madrid for sure and probably try to hit up lisbon on my last few days before coming back to the united states and london will be the spot I fly into so those 3 will be done before or by june 8th (besides lisbon). So I wanted to fill in the gaps. I would want to chose 1 of rome or athens. Then the must haves for me would be prague, paris, amsterdam, budapest. My "would like to's" would be switzerland, belgium, vienna and auschwitz.

Would Madrid to rome then fly  to budapest, prague, amsterdam, belgium, and paris be impossible? I would have MAYBE 20 days to do the above mentioned Must haves.

Also would you recomend eurail for this (400 usd for a 10 day global pass)  or separate plane flights?

Also what about airbnb in these locations? I prefer to stay in a cheap hotel or airbnb (thinking no more than 50 bucks a night preferably less)  and I don't want to stay in hostels.

Besides plane flights and lodging how much would you safely budget for food, and spending money?

&#x200B;

Thanks again., will70723
ehaydc0, auizqx, 2019-02-26 06:03:17,2019, 2, 26,Thanks yea I think I'm going to try to narrow it down to about 6/7 cities. It's hard because I want to see so much stuff. Because honestly I don't know when I will ever have the time or opportunity again.  I guess my highlights would be split into 2 sections  areas I could train to (  budapest, prague, vienna and then on western europe paris, amsterdam and belgium. Those might be my highlights. I am lucky enough to have about a week before staying in spain that I can land into london and stay there for 2/3 days and get that off my checklist. So I guess  my cities that I either have to leave out or figure out how to squeeze them in to an already croweded 6 cities would be rome, switzerland and possibly parts of germany. 

Hopefully this is possible., will70723
eh8hcdz, auizqx, 2019-02-25 09:30:57,2019, 2, 25,Definitely something I was thinking about when you mentioned flights. I checked out ryanair I believe it was. I just heard that train might take longer but counting check in time and getting to airport it usually doesn't save much time? But if I do go the flight route would you recommend not buying the eurail pass? I looked up flights through several of these countries the other day (mostly between 50-100 usd ) to places like madrid to rome or athens to budapest or even prague to paris.

&#x200B;

So if airlines are cheaper, and faster I could definitely switch it up and go the flying method over the eurail. I just liked how easy, included and location centered eurail is. Plus might be able to see a lot of sites on the train ride and get some sleep instead of paying for hotels a few nights on overnight trains.

&#x200B;

And I'm youngish 37 so I do want to hit up a few tourist spots (museums, Eiffel tower, buckingham palace, coliseum ) but also would like to find a few local chill spots in some of the bigger and smaller cities (in prague, budapest lisbon madrid) to save money, see the culture, and try new foods. So I'm literally up for anything. I would describe my ideal vacation as being the "best value" which I would say includes overall money, less travel time, best sites to see, and memorable experience.

&#x200B;

Basically have 20 days for these places ( 32 days in total when you count flying into london and madrid for 8 days before heading out to these places) I would like to get away with doing 2 days in most cities and probably 3 days in paris, rome, prague maybe amsterdam or amsterdamn and surrounding cities. Possible or too short?, will70723
eh8jtv5, auizqx, 2019-02-25 10:47:58,2019, 2, 25,I think you've set yourself an almost impossible target here. You've got a load of capital cities where accommodation and food isn't cheap and you're trying to do it for $50 a night but no hostels! You may be able to find some rooms on Airbnb but they may be a way out from the tourist sites and main terminals. I think if you want to do things on a budget then you'd need to trim back on the destinations to save on flight and train costs and give yourself time and money back to maybe get a place a littler out of the centre where you can self cater to save some cash by eating a big breakfast before you go out for the day and to take a little snack with you to keep you going.
All those cities will be really expensive especially all around the tourist sites. Paris and London are both really expensive. Rome and Madrid a little less so but still not cheap. I think you should prioritise what things you want to see in each location and give them a score of importance to give that location a total must see score. Then try and roughly work out how many days you'd need there to see that stuff. How much it will roughly cost you to get there, by train or by plane, find out some rough accommodation costs, look up some average costs for food and drink whilst there and so each place then has a rough cost to get there and stay there and you can budget them up. You can then decide which places don't give you enough for the money and cut them out. Personally I'm less of a fan of the capital cities, they're nothing like the country itself. They're capitals and are generally big, busy, noisy international cities full of tourists seeing the same sights and after all that bustle it's just not that relaxing. If you stay just outside the centre in a quiet neighborhood you'll get a better feel for living there at least, find your own local spots like a nice quiet square to sit in and have a drink and watch the locals go about their lives. The centre of Rome was like Disneyland with selfie sticks, it was nothing like Italy which I love it's relaxed vibe. The Vatican was like a massive queuing system at a fairground with big security gates and scanners, fences, guides and touts and the blending of mass tourism, religious fervour and capitalism was incredibly strange. Expensive tickets, big queues and people were then taking selfies inside with the mummified popes in their glass cases! Very odd, not the solemn spiritual or reverent experience I was expecting and to be honest I was expecting the inside to be more unique inside but I've seen a lot of cathedrals and churches all around Europe and it didn't really stand out for me. It's obviously hugely symbolic but I think you get that from seeing the spectacle of the outside with the big square and whole religious district its in than seeing inside. The tour of St Paul's cathedral in London has more stuff to see I think with the climb up to the huge dome and the famous people interred in the basement. Lot smaller queues as well and just as impressive a space inside. Good audio tour to do.
One thing I would add is that Milan has a tradition of giving free food in bars around 5pm. They expect you to get a drink but the drinks are cheap there and the food is pretty good and filling. It's kind of a hot and cold buffet at the bar with pasta and stuff. That can be a good way of enjoying time with locals in a normal bar and saving some money. It's also relatively close to Verona, the lakes and Venice which are all really nice places to visit and see more authentic Italian cities, ok maybe not so much Venice, that's a bit of a Disney ride as well but it's pretty unique and it's probably not going to be around forever.
Amsterdam is another busy tourist city. I'd suggest Utrecht which is the second biggest city and a short 35mins by train. It's like a mini Amsterdam with gorgeus canals and cobbled streets with lots of flowers, it's easy to hire a bike or little boat to explore and there are loads of lovely bars and cafes by the canals or squares to sit and watch the world go by and it's a lot less abrasive and packed with rowdy drunk tourists than Amsterdam is. Yet if you want to see all of that it's close enough to take the train there.
I'd always suggest to avoid the main capitals and to stay outside and do day trips in to see what sites you want to see. Capitals are always the tourist trap where you pay more for less. Smaller cities are often better and more unique memorable experiences where you're not just taking the same photos you've seen millions of times already. You're more likely to be surprised by something or to not have any pre conceived expectations so you're less likely to be disappointed by the reality.
It sounds like an awesome long holiday though so I hope you get it all worked out and have a great time., Motchan13
eh8ohtb, auizqx, 2019-02-25 12:42:42,2019, 2, 25,The best thing about this is the fact you consider yourself on the young side - it's more common that people think they're too old to travel at 25 when they obviously are not. 

The real problems are elsewhere. First off, you appear to have have too many places on your list. You'll be spending too much time in transit and will end up seeing rather little once you actually get where you're going. Second, once you narrow down your list of places, check if a rail pass even is worth it - chances are it isn't worth it even with your current plan. Individual train tickets will work fine, particularly when you know when you're going where, but it's up to you to do the maths. Then there's the budget issue - some places are cheaper, like Budapest and Prague, and then if you stop in Switzerland, you'll eat up many Budapest days' worth of budget in no time. If money is tight, go to fewer places and stay longer where it's more affordable. , Intup
ehacn7u, auizqx, 2019-02-26 01:03:03,2019, 2, 26,2 days is way to short and your compounding your costs by constantly traveling. All you'll end up doing is having a meal and maybe taking in a site. Even with proper budgeting you'll encounter situations where you'll take the train from the airport to the city and that will eat half your daily budget. If you were to visit your own country does a plan to visit Seattle, LA, NYC and Miami make much sense? , canucker78
eh8k5oi, auizqx, 2019-02-25 10:57:44,2019, 2, 25,I appreciate this response as well. I will look into "alternate cities" in these countries that I want to see. As well as try to come up with another plan to maybe trim some cities down or turn them into smaller cheaper cities. I think I can get all my plane flights down to about 1,200 usd. That includes my flight from san francisco to london, all the short european flights and a flight back from europe to San Francisco. 

My biggest cost besides flights is going to be hotels or airbnb. But I don't have to strict of needs when it comes to lodging. I just need a private room, and somewhat near locations to see. That could be either walking, uber or short bus rides.  I would ultimately like to keep my trip under 2,500 usd but not sure if its possible. , will70723
ehae8fv, auizqx, 2019-02-26 01:23:23,2019, 2, 26,That makes sense. Everyone says its too much. I guess I want to do and see everything. Just curious what cities or countries on my list could I cut out and probably wouldnt regret it too much or at least get a similar experience somewhere else.
 
I guess I figured too be to advetourous in too short of a time frame. I was thinking I could do 1 week in the paris/amsterdam area. A week in prague/budapest area and rome up to switzerland area. Maybe these 3 overall areas is what I can focus on and maybe trim some cities out.

Edit: I guess I have a bad assumption of hostels maybe for no good reason. Would you guys be fine staying in hostels? Im the type that really likes my own sleeping space though, will70723
eh8lqz2, auizqx, 2019-02-25 11:41:27,2019, 2, 25,The 2500 price isn't feasible, it's not even close. Even trying to use cheap transit, flights 
and lodging that will eat up 2500 by itself. What will happen is early on you'll freeze up and youll become apprehensive about your spending habits. Just downsize your inteniary,  I would look into heading into Spain directly, spend some time in Portugal and pick one other destination. Enjoy your time in Europe,  dont try and see all of Europe., canucker78
ehalz67, auizqx, 2019-02-26 02:59:35,2019, 2, 26,With 20ish days I would try and pick one side of Europe to focus on. I would do either Rome/Athens then Budapest to Prague by train. Or focus on western Europe doing Paris, Belgium and Amsterdam. You can always come back in the future and see other side.

Your accommodation options will depend on the city and country. Just be diligent and look at each option.

eh8ynxa, auizqx, 2019-02-25 15:23:18,2019, 2, 25,Really you think 2500 usd isnt do-able? I thought this should be pretty easy. For the week of june 1st to june 8th I'm staying in madrid FORE FREE. Thats lodging and food 100 percent free so thats about 8 days of being in Madrid for free. I should of mentioned that earlier. So that leaves basically my "paid" trip from  June 9th til lets estimate june 25/26. Plus a few days before June 1st when I fly in. 

So far my rough numbers I was able to come up with plane flights $1,150 (that includes plane into europe and plane back to united states plus ALL the quick plane flights of all the cities I have listed in my previous messages (the more cities I cut down on on that $1,150)  that leaves me at least $1,300 to spend on food and lodging (in about  maybe 20 days?) this is all assuming I would hit all those cities. So if I cut it down even more and shorten the trip a little that $1,150 should go down a decent amount as well as hotel/airbnb cost?

&#x200B;

Any advice on where to stay? I heard airbnb you can get decent places on the level of a hotel but with your own place? Would you recommend airbnb over a hotel? Also I could "cheapen" my trip by staying longer at some of these smaller cities and stay at an airbnb longer in these smaller cities?

&#x200B;

Thanks again to everyone. I will take a lot of pics plus i make short documentary/vids I will make sure to post the link to them when I get back from my trip., will70723
eh98zat, auizqx, 2019-02-25 17:27:35,2019, 2, 25,$2500 including transatlantic is 100% not doable. $2500, excluding transatlantic flights, would still be tough. You would have to be smart about where you go (i.e. minimizing travel because of the cost) and where you stay (i.e. hostels). Airbnb is great for groups, since you have more people to spread the costs around, but will not be nearly as economical for a solo traveler. You need to map out a logical route, using resources like booking.com for loding, seat61.com for train info, and google flights for potential flights and see what makes sense with your budget. It also might be better for you to cut down the length of your trip to increase the quality of it, if your budget is that thin.


For reference, I'm going on a ~22 day Europe trip this summer, and my lodging+Europe only travel costs (so not including transatlantic flights) is around $1400. That does not include food, drink, tourist sites, public transport within the cities, or anything else. , steeveee12
eh9e532, auizqx, 2019-02-25 18:25:38,2019, 2, 25,Google flights is where I'm booking my flights from sfo to london ($375/400 usd)

I looked up ryanair and easy jet all the flights in europe were as low as 49 up to 92 usd so add in aprox

 $450 bucks.

&#x200B;

Then the return flight is 400 bucks at most (found a few in mid to lower 300's)

So that roughly puts me at 1100 for complete round trip plus flights in europe.

&#x200B;

I have been able to find airbnb private homes in most cities for 50 bucks and under pretty easy (just depends on picking specific neighborhoods and distance from place) so  $50 a night x roughly 18 days =$900 (I know a few cities will be way less than that from research but wanted to use $50 as the average to play it safe)

**Is there a better option besides airbnb and higher than a hostel?**

&#x200B;

That just leaves food and whatever spending money ( I budget very well and dont blow money on unnecessary things but also will spend a little extra in a couple places)

So realistically speaking without taking out any of the locations ( which I know I'm probably going to have to) that puts me at about $2,100 bucks before food. Now if I cut back on some of the locations that should probably lower me closer to $1,700 or so.  which would leave me about 800 bucks on food and whatever spending money for about 18 days which is do-able with my budgeting.

Or am I missing something?, will70723
eh9rg2e, auizqx, 2019-02-25 20:46:44,2019, 2, 25,Nobody here can really help you until you put together a cohesive plan. For example, if youre talking about western capital cities/switzerland/etc then everyone will tell you your budget is nuts. If you put together an itinerary consisting of lower cost options, that's another thing. Go figure out what 4/5 cities (maybe less, maybe more) you want to see in the 18 days you have, and then we can help out some more., steeveee12
eh9teg0, auizqx, 2019-02-25 21:07:47,2019, 2, 25,I would say must have cities would be. Paris, budapest, prague, one of either rome or athens (someone mentioned milan?) amsterdam/belgium area. 

I am fine going to the "bigger expensive" cities for a short amount of time maybe even just a day trip and staying close by in a small town. It's more about exploring and being able to say I been their. 

I would probably spend most of my time in smaller cities like prague, lisbon, budapest where I could have cheaper expenses maybe stay at those places 2-4 days and then the bigger cities maybe 1-2 day trips. 

&#x200B;

I was even debating about taking overnight trains on eurail to "get free" overnight stays without staying a hotel or airbnb a few of the nights. 

Plus I can take ryanair or easy jet to see 1 or 2 countries fairly quick in a day or 2 span which is fine with me.

  
Hopefully this helps.

eh9uypf, auizqx, 2019-02-25 21:24:42,2019, 2, 25,That does help. 

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

Its pretty busy for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point., steeveee12

That does help.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

**( I was thinking of doing eurail but alot of trains are long cheap air planes seem quicker) but I might combine eurail and easy jet flights?**

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

**( I would probably stay in this region longer then bigger cities because of price and make little day trips to surrounding countries here.)**

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

**(This is where I would start to use ryanair or easy jet probably from madrid to rome or madrid to athens which then I would take another cheap fight from either rome or athens up to budapest before using trains in that region.)**

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

**( I would probably pass on train this way too long and take a cheap flight, at this point I'm wondering if a eurail pass would even be worth it for me? since I would be taking a lot of cheap flights)**

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

**( I planned on flying from sfo to london spending a day or 2 there to get it off my checklist. Then taking a plane from london to lisbon or madrid spending 3-5 days there before my obligations in madrid that start go from June 1st-8th. So after the 8th I looked at it geography wise and was either going to fly to paris and go paris-amsterdam- prauge - budapest that direction. Or the complete opposite from madrid-rome-budapest-prague-amsterdam-and then paris.)**

Its on the busier side for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point., will70723

Not necessarily. For something like domestic USA or USA to Canada you'll usually find that a "return" flight is priced as 2 one way flights anyway. Or you might find that the flight there is cheaper on airline A but the flight home is cheaper on airline B. For more long haul international like USA to Australia for example you usually get a much better deal on a return ticket then 2 seperate one way flights.

Correct. Nothing to worry about. , cupp95
ehaas6k, auqlv2, 2019-02-26 00:38:01,2019, 2, 26,Last summer I flew US-Caribbean on two one-way tickets on two different airlines. When I checked in for the outbound flight with Delta, the agent asked for return information because she obviously couldn't see any. I gave her the AA flight numbers, and I was good to go.

The only issue I encountered was that when I checked in with American Airlines for my return home, I got SSSS on my boarding pass. I suspect it was because I was a male traveling alone on a one-way ticket into the US, but I don't know. I got TSA Pre (which I signed up for, not a freebie) on the outbound on Delta., gt_ap
eh9ws3l, auqlv2, 2019-02-25 21:44:41,2019, 2, 25,So you have to make sure you aren't checking luggage. If you are, then you need to book significant layovers as you'll need to exit, collect your bags, re-check them, and go through security again. If there is customs/immigration add even more time.

Next, you must have the proper visas to enter wherever your "layovers" are or your airline might not let you on the plane. So lets say you find a cheap flight going through Russia, doesn't matter if you aren't planning on leaving the airport, because your flight to Russia won't care or believe that you are flying on. They'll need to make sure you have the proper visa.

You are right some places require you have a flight out of the country. I had a two "one way" flights from Costa Rica on different airlines, so I had to have my 2nd airline print off proof that I was leaving Costa Rica and show that to airline 1 before they'd let me on the plane., jadeoracle

Depends on where you're going. For domestic routes, routes like USA to Canada and LCC a "return fare" is generally priced as 2 x one way tickets. , cupp95

They will try to grow grapes anywhere, but you Malolactic is going to get all fucked without the cooling of the grapes....hence most are grown in regions that are warm during day and cool at night - or areas with coast - Italy, France, N.

eh9zekq, auqfnd, 2019-02-25 22:14:08,2019, 2, 25,Here are some places to consider visiting along the way:

Big Basin State Park (near Santa Cruz)

The Monterrey Aquarium is a must.

The mission at Carmel

Hearst Castle near San Simeon

Big Sur River Inn for drinks. The chairs are in the river!

Pinnacles National Park, if you're going down Hwy 101 instead of Hwy 1 (take the backside, Highway 25...it's beautiful and deserted)

The town of Ojai (near Santa Barbara) is supposed to be very nice although I haven't been there myself.


An interesting thing about Moss Landing is that the [Monterrey Canyon](https://www.google.com/search?q=monterey+Canyon&safe=off&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=BqUhTrjzXrzApM%253A%252CswY-c3Iaiu10gM%252C_&usg=AI4_-kRL3Q5cv1krhJL6WvQMQR7Up08RKQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie3um_89fgAhVVnJ4KHYQJACQQ9QEwAXoECAMQJg&biw=2203&bih=1223#imgrc=BqUhTrjzXrzApM:) begins just offshore. It's pretty amazing, and a boat tour might be very interesting for you. You could also try paddle boarding or kayaking in the slough. That said, I tend to agree with the other poster about Moss Landing not being the nicest place in the world to stay. The are a lot of options in Monterrey.

One thing to remember: the ocean in Central CA is great to look at, but you won't be going into it for more than a few minutes: it's freezing and treacherous. The water gets warmer once you're in Santa Barbara and points south.

Enjoy! Considering that you're between two huge population centers, it's surprising how unpopulated the central coast is., PoxyMusic

the UK isn't in the schengen zone now, and won't be still after brexit.  the procedure last time i went in 2016 was lax: the guy in the immigration booth will just want you to open your passport to your photo page and he/she will wave you through no problem.

You could fly into Mexico City and spend a few days there then take a cheap flight on Vivaaerobus to Merida or Cancun. Merida is a very nice city with unique cuisine and culture. You could rent a car to drive to Chichen Itza and the coast. The northern coast of the Yucatan isnt as nice as the south, but there are tropical beaches , koreamax
eh98265, aunb0p, 2019-02-25 17:16:46,2019, 2, 25,Well you definitely must go to Chiapas and Quintana Roo there you will find the most incredible ruins in Mexico such as Palenque, Chichen Itza and Tulum. There are also amazing caribbean beaches just around the corner. On the other hand, if you want to see city landscapes you should visit Mexico City or Guadalajara, you can take a fly from Chiapas to Mexico City or Guadalajara for approx 83 CAD ;), BoSicle

eh9e8zp, aunb0p, 2019-02-25 18:26:49,2019, 2, 25,Just got back from a week in Oaxaca State - it was absolutely fantastic and it sounds perfect for what you're looking for.

Oaxaca City itself is great; it's walkable, very pretty and clean, and the food is amazing. It also has a very laid-back vibe to it, with good chill nightlife options and good cafes to sit in and read books during the heat of the day. Also felt extremely safe, we walked home to our Airbnb late at night from the bars and never had any worries. Night and day from the semi-controlled chaos of Mexico City.

Great day trips to be had as well, highly recommend Hierve de Agua, which is up in the mountains about 90 minutes outside of Oaxaca City. Beautiful hiking trails and stunning natural mineral baths, and was not too crowded when we were there. Check out some pictures online. There are also great Zapotec ruins in Mitla (a picturesque town on the road to Hierve de Agua), and the massive  Monte Alban site as well - which I believe are the largest pre-Columbian ruins in Mexico. And of course the mezcal farms / distilleries as well.

We tacked on the beach - we flew with AeroTucan to Puerto Escondido, and spent a few days there as well. Fantastic town with a great traveler culture and more good vibes. We booked an open-jaw to fly with AeroMexico into Oaxaca City and out of Huatulco, so we didn't have to backtrack to get home. Huatulco is about 90 minutes by cab from Puerto Escondido, and will cost \~$40 in a taxi.

Can't say enough good things about Oaxaca, and can't wait to go back.

eh9rswz, aunb0p, 2019-02-25 20:50:32,2019, 2, 25,Most likely you won't need $2000 CAD for a week in Mexico. I'd say realistically like $1500 but having $2000 is good too. 

>The other idea was to go somewhere in Yucatán, as that looks very attractive from a nature and Mayan ruins perspective, but here we are concerned that there is not enough to see from a city perspective (restaurants, landmarks that aren't the Mayan ruins, etc.)

There is a lot to do that will have cultural stuff. Snorkel in Isla Mujeres's under water museum. See underwater houses and statues while snorkeling or scuba diving. 

Day trip from Cancun to Chichen Itza and Day trip from Cancun to Tulum. See beautiful ruins and cenotes too. , HighestHand

ehanheu, aunb0p, 2019-02-26 03:18:16,2019, 2, 26,I'd recommend Oaxaca or San Cristobal.

I'd say culture-wise Oaxaca has a bit more of an authentic feel and is really well known for its food, though I love how picturesque San Cristobal is.

For day trips/natural beauty: In Oaxaca you've got Hierve el Agua and maybe a beach if you're ambitious. In San Cristobal there's the Sumidero Canyon and Palenque. I'd say Palenque > Tulum > Chichen Itza for ruins mostly because you can actually climb them.

I didn't get to go to Guadalajara when I went but it looks amazing so I'd consider that too!, throwaway385621
eh981zg, aunb0p, 2019-02-25 17:16:43,2019, 2, 25,I second the suggestion of Merida and exploring southern Yucatan.

eh9amt2, aukzzu, 2019-02-25 17:46:39,2019, 2, 25,Hear me out. If you are looking for safe and low risk, then ignore. 

&#x200B;

If you want some stories you can tell when this trip is long done then you need to go outside your comfort zone. You need to create or find a little chaos. Most of the best stories in the world involve something "bad in the moment" but later looking back on it with fondness. 

It's about finding the right people who can take you on this journey. Try to find someone or a group of people who will let you in and go along in an adventure. This means striking up random conversation with people. Anyone. Everywhere. Some people are naturals at this, and for some people it's work. Regardless, it's the surest way to lead to anything interesting on a trip.

Going to the sites are minimal and usually just par for the course. It's when we interact with fascinating people (whether that means cool, unique, unusual, informative, memorable, insane opinions, etc.) but it's the crazy ppl you meet along the journey that can make a trip a little more than just feeling like a tourist with a bullet list. And sometimes those people we meet will lead us to the most memorable part of the trip. The only part of the trip you may remember months after it is passed.

&#x200B;

Seek these people out. Or next time travel with someone who is extroverted to balance the equation and let them do the work for you. I am lucky in that I learned this from a VERY outgoing friend who ALWAYS seeks the chaos. He is exactly who you want to find on a travel trip. Just by striking up conversation to random people it has led me to things like ending up flying in someone's Cessna getting a bird's eye view of the Caribbean, having an unbelievable night with the cutest girl in Brazil (friend of the person we struck convo with that we met later in the night), meeting a guy who took us to an underground cockfighting party on a farm who then the next day had us do farm work like cutting off horns of a cows etc. That was way more interesting than if we just visited the churches in Colombia. 

Obviously it doesn't always lead to the best story ever, but it is certainly the avenue to.

Personally I prefer going to a cool bar or having local cuisine.   I'm in Rome currently and mostly I just want to sit out on the sunny terrace and enjoy some warm sunlight and enjoy the down time. 

Barcelona has terrific food and cocktails.   Social media definitely makes it harder to enjoy things because we bombarded with BS posts of people seemingly having mind blowing experiences.  I find that all to be pretty Meh. Lol

You spend so much time queuing and stop-starting you never get to really sit down for more than 30mins or so and by the time you get there you're more tired than if you'd just relaxed on the train for a few hours and slept, read a book or watched something.
I love getting the Eurostar. Airports are just annoying people hell.
As other people have said if you factor in the cost and time spent getting to and through the airports either side and to your final destination I bet you don't really save much time and you'll feel more burnt out. On the train you can sit back with a huge window and a drink, big comfy seat. No brainer for me, if you don't have to save the minutes travel in style., Motchan13

eh8fklp, auixc4, 2019-02-25 08:38:17,2019, 2, 25,The train will probably be faster overall. The train journey itself is obviously longer than the flight. But it's direct from central London to central Amsterdam. You don't have to travel to and from airports or wait for your bags in Amsterdam. You do have to be at the railway station in advance, but not as far in advance as at the airport. Also, you get to go in a tunnel under the sea!

When calculating the price for flights, make sure you include the cost of travel to and from airports in the price in order to better compare it with the train. It might still work out cheaper.

eh9tdyq, auixc4, 2019-02-25 21:07:37,2019, 2, 25,Hard to say...do I prefer getting to and from airports, waiting in check in queues, going through security queues, having to be at the gate lounge well ahead of the flight, being squashed in a coach seat for an hour, waiting at luggage carousels on landing...or do I prefer arriving at a station in the city centre, minimal wait as I get through immigration/security, have no problems arriving on the platform minutes before departure and alighting near the town centre after five hours in a spacious seat?

eh8y484, auixc4, 2019-02-25 15:16:10,2019, 2, 25,Yeah, be sure to add price to get to the airport, particularly in London. It's not so bad if you can get to Heathrow or City but that would definitely add to the price.

One think to keep in mind is that you will need to get out at Brussels to handle immigration so it's not nearly as seamless as going the other way where you can do Schengen immigration in London., LupineChemist

ehajidr, auixc4, 2019-02-26 02:28:52,2019, 2, 26,The train is definitely faster city-center-to-city-center in that direction. And when you take into account the cost of getting to/from London's airports in a reasonable amount of time, it's often cheaper as well.

It's also a lot less hassle, you get more seat room, you can bring more stuff, and you spend the time sitting down rather than running around going through airport mazes., crackanape

eh9rnq7, auixc4, 2019-02-25 20:48:59,2019, 2, 25,In general I'd prefer the train, but it really depends on how you think Brexit will pan out.

St Pancras (the station where the Eurostars leave from) can already be a shitshow at peak periods (especially Friday evening), as the terminal doesn't have enough space for all the passengers. Add any additional Brexit-related passport / security checks and [Eurostar has already said that they won't be able to cope](https://www.ft.com/content/5de0950e-35e9-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812).

Personally I'd plan to fly during April - whilst there will be some queues, Schiphol at least as the space to cope with Brexit. , markvauxhall

eharmxy, auusrz, 2019-02-26 04:11:14,2019, 2, 26,Florence is gorgeous. I’d do two nights in the Cinque Terre and two in Florence. , Kiwitechgirl
ehauyhm, auusrz, 2019-02-26 05:01:09,2019, 2, 26,Cinque Terre was okay. I went for a weekend this past summer and the trails were closed due to a mud slide so the hike that would’ve only taken us an hour or so would’ve taken 4 hours. We didn’t do really any research before hand, we just went and expected to be able to hike all 5 cities in one weekend. Not possible lol. It was still totally gorgeous and the beach was amazing. If you plan it better than we did, I feel like you would love Cinque Terre. 

EDIT: if you do decide to go, I highly suggest getting [this train ticket ](https://imgur.com/F4OYzVy)  or see if they offer a 3 day pass (I’m pretty sure they do.) you can use the bathrooms for free, take whatever train you want, have WiFi almost everywhere, etc. It lists it all on [the back of the ticket. ](https://imgur.com/Hg33eGV) 

I stayed in Siena for 3 weeks. It’s about an hour and a half south of Florence by train. It was my favorite city out of all the places I visited in Italy. Siena is so beautiful and historic and rustic. Words can’t even begin to describe it. Siena has everything from old museums and historic sight seeing to shopping to mom and pop restaurants to five star restaurants. Such a beautiful city you could easily spend 3-4 days in and still feel like you haven’t seen everything. 100000000% suggest this!!  

If you have any questions about Siena (which I really hope you do) please feel free to PM me! I have a few places I highly recommend and would like to live vicariously through you visiting them lol. , idcwhodis

ehaz28b, auusrz, 2019-02-26 06:17:30,2019, 2, 26,Pisa is an easy day trip from Florence. It's neat to see once but not worth spending a lot of time at. I'd recommend stopping by the small medieval town of Lucca on your way back to Florence of you do decide to stay there. It's a cute Tuscan town that I liked a lot more than Pisa! Easily accessible by train.

Florence has the statue of David which is worth seeing for sure. If you're into art the Uffizi museum is neat (it has the birth of Venus painting). Piazza del Michaelangelo has amazing sunset views and the Duomo is really neat architecture. Florence also had the best gelato I had in Italy - La Carraia., biologist_bride

Petra is a mission, because you have to cross the border and is far.

And they have told you at least several reasons why it's also rated 4 stars.

Santa Monica (and other cities in LA like WeHo) have also cracked down on Airbnb so under $100/night options will be tough to find.

There isn't any "central" area to stay in LA so it really depends on what you want to see. With 10 days, consider splitting up your stay in different neighborhoods.

I've found that most hotels won't charge you for a reasonable Amazon-sized box, even if they advertise on the website that they such charge a fee (this is not universal - NYC hotels are reliable about charging fees in my experience for example).

Really in Ortisei you will be skiing on Geisler range which is one of the most photogenic with Sass Ragais and Furchetta. [This is a good spot of the range from near Santa Magdelena.](https://goo.gl/maps/f2xqXX43UgD2)

Could do a bit of snow shoeing to get to [Cinque Torri as well.](https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/snowshoeing/cinque-torri-snow-shoe-hike/), swollencornholio
eh9v83u, auo2hb, 2019-02-25 21:27:32,2019, 2, 25,Raschötz is a great point to view the surrounding mountains, you can take the train from Ortisei and return by sledge if you are able to rent or bring one. Then there's the Seceda which is very famous (both for the geisler and the Langkofel/ Plattkofel view). Some very pretty motives are also from the Alpe di Siusi. Head towards harlt alm or towards Hotel Ikaro/ Hotel Panorama from the mountain station. All of these spots are within reach via cable way from Ortisei.
Next I'd suggest Karer See (towards Bozen), and definitely ski and/or drive the sellaronda. Don't miss out on the Marmolada - it's the only glacier in the Dolomites and you can ski on it. Would highly recommend it. 
A bit of a longer drive, but definitely worth it is Pragser Wildsee.  It's currently frozen over, so you can walk across it. For skiing I would also recommend Kromplatz, especially if you are experienced. Bruneck is a cute medieval- ish town. 
Val di Funes gives a very nice view towards the geisler with a chapel in the foreground. , kokoberry4

eh9ay1t, auntek, 2019-02-25 17:50:08,2019, 2, 25,I often do Orlando in 2 days only (lots of business trips) and only go alone. I love it. 

You can either do just Disney and try to do all 4 parks in 2 days (or if you are insane all 4 in 1 day) but I generally like to pick one park and just explore it. 

Universal is perfect for 1 day trips. I get a park hopper and focus on one thing that day, like just Harry Potter lands, or just roller coasters. Universal has a lot of great single rider lines, so you can easily do some rides over and over again.

If you need any advice on either of those two theme parks let me know, I really go there too often on 1/2 day trips so I have a ton of tips.

I've done Miami alone also on a 2 day trip, and didn't like it. Sure the beach is fine, but the nightlife wasn't fun to do it alone.

San Francisco, also have done alone on a 2 day trip. I've done a few Chinatown walking tours that have been fun. I've also done a 2 day Nappa Valley trip, visited the petrified forest and then hit some wineries. Or you could head out to the Winchester Mystery house.

I've done Monterey on a 2ish day trip. Day 1 driving down to Carmel, see the sunset by the beach, Day 2 the aquarium in the morning (my friends did a drive to pebble beach instead) then drive back. We did the Winchester House on the way back I think. So it was a pretty full 2 days.

I've only been in Toronto for a day. I highly recommend the aquarium they have there.

Also a fan of Washington DC for short trips. Have you been to Mount Vernon? I did that on one of my trips and enjoyed the boat ride there and hanging out in the gardens. Nice change of pace., jadeoracle

eh911b0, aulmzy, 2019-02-25 15:53:16,2019, 2, 25,1. Definitely feasible. Only part that looks a little quick is the beginning on Lake Como depending on what time you arrive.
2. Stay in Como if it budget is blown in Varenna. In experience Como can be cheaper than Milan when it comes to accommodations.
3. You'll really enjoy 4 nights in Sorrento, especially at the end of that trip. I would not change that. I personally had 5 nights in the Amalfi+Naples and it was a good amount of time but I probably could have stayed more. It's fairly easy to get to Pompeii from Sorrento so if you want to avoid trying to figure out what to do with your bag I would just build that into the Sorrento part of your stay. On a hostel budget I stayed in Ercolano which for sure added travel time to the Amalfi coast everyday so if you could afford Sorrento definitely do it.

Card games are always a good option for travel days.

I forget what this game is called, but you have a piece of paper, everyone writes a sentence out, then you pass it, and the next person draws the sentence, and then pass it again and the next person writes a sentence about the drawing. Kind of like telephone but with paper.

A drinking game that you could probably turn into a non drinking game is The Captian. Someone is The Captian, and when they freeze in place everyone has to do the exact same thing.

So just declare it and it may-or-may-not be taxed. My guess is that for a few bottles of homemade wine, they won't bother with the formalities of applying an import duty.

Note that "duty-free" that you see in the airport has no relevance with respect to your import limits.

eh8qmih, auki8p, 2019-02-25 13:22:54,2019, 2, 25,> Also according to TSA I can bring 5 liters in checked baggage, but only 1 liter duty free? any info please.

It means that the homemade wine bottles can only be in your checked baggage. If you want to get extra alcohol/wine/liquor etc inside the cabin plane, you can only get/buy them from the stores in the airport and can only be 1 liter max (i.e. two 500ml bottles).

The stamps and silverware should be no problem, as long as you don't bring a suitcase of them., SwingNinja
eh8u906, auki8p, 2019-02-25 14:21:35,2019, 2, 25,I don't think there's a limit on the alcohol purchased after security (in those tamper-proof bags). 

Wine is also under 24 percent, so there's no limit in checked baggage.

ehagd9i, autbl2, 2019-02-26 01:49:41,2019, 2, 26,Wow. Your plan is way too ambitious. Italy for two weeks is much more realistic. Or a week in the UK and a week in France. But what you’re suggesting is just silly. Why even go to London for 36 hours? Barely enough time to get properly sauced at the pub. , wholehogbbq
ehahh96, autbl2, 2019-02-26 02:03:39,2019, 2, 26,That amount of time in any one of those locations will make you feel as fulfilled as getting a postcard of Michelangelo’s David. For some people that may be enough, but I strongly suggest you pick two, maybe three destinations if they are close by train. Do some research based off what if important to you and you won’t be disappointed. Spend time getting to know the city, not getting to know their airports!

ehag2af, autbl2, 2019-02-26 01:45:57,2019, 2, 26,Ya, too much. Pick two countries. Travel around them by train. Try to fly only once. Do 4 cities max. 5 if you have to stay somewhere overnight before flying home.
 
Here is the thing I try to accomplish. Spending as little time in transit while in Europe but see as much as possible. When you spend a quarter of your trip moving, you are wasting valuable time. , ruglescdn

ehaho9b, autbl2, 2019-02-26 02:06:03,2019, 2, 26,Wayyyy too much. I’d say 3 destinations for 2 weeks is ideal. You could use London to fly into, and then head down to Paris, Rome, Florence, and then maybe Athens for the night and then a ferry to an island. I’d suggest 4 days in Paris, 2 in Rome, 2 in Florence and 6 days in Athens/island destination, that is assuming you want to spend time on a beach, which is why I gave you so much time in Athens, as that would just be a boatover city. , AsuPartier

ehaojbm, autbl2, 2019-02-26 03:31:17,2019, 2, 26,Maybe a plan of 4 days in Paris, then flying to Italy to spend 10 days. You'll want at least 3 days in each Italian city so maybe a breakdown of 4 in Rome, 3 in Florence and 3 in Venice.

Well, yeah, if your passport weren't expired, you wouldn't need the extra verification. The whole point of the extra verification is you don't have the proper ID., tariqabjotu

Based on what? People lose their wallets during their trips, leaving them with less than what you have. Domestically, you don't marooned. It's not optimal, but such is the case. If you didn't want to risk it, you should have renewed your passport., tariqabjotu

This is not correct. You could potentially use it to return to the US, as it cannot deny a citizen entry, but every other country is more likely than not to refuse you entry. And an airline is unlikely to let you fly there at all., Oroso
eh8b6if, auhswr, 2019-02-25 06:48:46,2019, 2, 25,Based on my pessimistic outlook lol

You’re right, though. People lose their wallets. Shit happens! I’m just worried. I’ve never been in this position before, so I’m concerned about the whole thing. Hell, if I get turned away at security, it wouldn’t matter as long as I can get a refund on my ticket. But I’ve always heard that airlines were notorious for not giving refunds. 

Also, I didn’t renew my passport because I haven’t traveled abroad in years and have had no plans on doing so anytime soon, so it was kinda irrelevant. I also didn’t think that it would take this long to get a regular freaking license. Stupid post office! , HenryBalzac
